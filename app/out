the best available examples of this seldom seen and still lesser understood aspect of Dove\xe2\x80\x99s work, the show will include works from 1930, the year in which he both took up the medium in earnest and made it an intrinsic aspect of his artistic endeavor, through the mid-1940s, when failing health slowed his output, but not his creative spirit and stylistic innovation The show will represent the largest and most comprehensive gathering of these drawings to date Including more than fifty-five watercolors, the full range and scope of Dove\xe2\x80\x99s interests and achievement will be on view All works will be borrowed from either private collections or museums, including The Herbert F Johnson Museum, Cornell University (Dove\xe2\x80\x99s alma mater), the Heckscher Museum of Art (which includes the recently founded Newsday Center for Dove/Torr Studies), and The Phillips Collection (which holds the largest single collection of Dove\xe2\x80\x99s work) Late sketchbook pages will be represented by The Arkansas Arts Center and The McNay Art Museum, both of which were among a handful of institutions to receive gifts from the Dove family Also included will be a select group of works never before seen in public on loan from the Dove Estate The exhibition will be accompanied by an eighty page illustrated catalogue with texts by Debra Bricker Balken and Anne Cohen DePietro Balken, a leading scholar of the first generation American modernists, was the lead curator of the 1997\xe2\x80\x9498 Dove retrospective, which traveled to the Whitney Museum, among other venues DePietro is founding Project Director of the Dove/Torr Study Center at the Heckscher Museum, to where the exhibition will travel in July Small in scale (usually measuring 5 x 7 inches, and later 3 x 4 or 4 x 5 inches), Dove\xe2\x80\x99s watercolors achieve radiance and use the translucent color to describe conditions of light and space Common motifs include the sea, sun, wind, and the many rhythms and cycles of nature Often using the fluid black line of a fountain pen to delineate form within the color, Dove\xe2\x80\x99s imagery moves increasingly toward abstraction in the late 1930s and early 40s Usually intended as studies for larger paintings, it is through these watercolors on paper that Dove first forged his most inventive and far-reaching expression Balken writes, \xe2\x80\x9c watercolor became (beginning in 1930) a routine staple of his output In fact, the medium represented a new formal challenge for Dove, its temporal dimension a metaphoric match for the mutable characteristics of nature\xe2\x80\x9d She continues, \xe2\x80\x9chis formal language alternated between organic and quasi-geometric forms nature now (after 1938) became construed as a dynamic yet wholly unknowable and mysterious structure\xe2\x80\x9d Even at his most abstract, however, Dove\xe2\x80\x99s subjects and imagery are rooted in direct observation and deep understanding of the natural world DePietro writes, \xe2\x80\x9cThroughout his life, even as he moved steadily toward abstraction, his work retained discernable elements that eloquently convey the spirit and geography of the rural communities in which he lived\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur Garfield Dove was born in 1880 in Geneva, New York, the son a successful contractor and builder After graduating Cornell University in 1903, Dove defied his father and set-off for New York where he briefly pursued a career as a commercial illustrator to support his art Following a trip to Europe to visit Alfred Maurer, Dove is credited as the first American\xe2\x80\x94perhaps first international\xe2\x80\x94artist to create wholly abstract paintings (1910\xe2\x80\x9411) After living in then rural communities (including Westport and Noroton, Connecticut) around New York City in the teens and early 1920s, Dove and his companion (later to be his second wife) Helen Torr, purchased a 42 yawl in 1922 They made their home on this boat for five years before settling in Halesite on the North Shore of Long Island In 1933 Dove and Torr returned to Dove\xe2\x80\x99s childhood home of Geneva to settle his parents\xe2\x80\x99 estate Five years later, in 1938, they returned to Long Island Sound and made their final home in a cottage on a tidal inlet in Centerport, New York (now the Dove/Torr Cottage) During his life, Dove exhibited his work regularly at the galleries of his dealer and patron Alfred Stieglitz He is considered a core member of the \xe2\x80\x9cStieglitz Group,\xe2\x80\x9d which includes artists such as Marsden Hartley, John Marin and Georgia O\xe2\x80\x99Keeffe Following Stieglitz\xe2\x80\x99 death, also in 1946, Dove\xe2\x80\x99s Estate was represented by Edith Halpert\xe2\x80\x99s The Downtown Gallery, and then later by Terry Dintenfass Major traveling exhibitions of Dove\xe2\x80\x99s work were organized in 1974 by Barbara Haskell (then at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art), and in 1997 by Debra Balken (for the Addison Gallery of American Art) In 1998 Dove and Torr\xe2\x80\x99s final home was acquired by the Heckscher Musuem of Art with assistance of the Times-Mirror corporation and the New York State Department of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation This site is being restored to its condition at the time that Dove and Torr lived there together (1938 \xe2\x80\x93 1946) The Newsday Center for Dove/Torr Studies is a founding member of Historic Artists\xe2\x80\x99 Homes and Studios, a program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation In 2002 the cottage was named to Save
